I specialize in React/Typescript applications development. My main focus is providing a positive experience to the user and to my collaborators, and I pay particular attention to accessibility and UX, code readability and maintainability and clear and clean architecture.

I love reviewing PRs! I love the opportunity to read other people's code and collaborate on improving the proposed solution.

I love starting side projects to learn new coding skills:

- ‚è∞ upgrading an old alarm clock to work with web radios thanks to a Raspberry Pi. I love to tinker and build and would love to complete a simple electronics project
- üõº a suite of tools in an Astro powered app for my roller derby league, including converting items in a Notion database to text suitable for Discord, and an interactive heatmap to visualize where skaters pass their opponents on the track. I aim to serve my teammates and building niche tools is a lot of fun.
- üì∞ I'm also currently enrolled in the [Data Journalism with Free Tools](https://journalismcourses.org/course/dataviz/) course. I'm interested in how code and data empowers storytelling: I'm a fan of [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/), data visualization, etc.
