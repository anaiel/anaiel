I specialize in React/Typescript applications development. My main focus is providing a positive experience to the user and to my collaborators, and I pay particular attention to accessibility and UX, code readability and maintainability and clear and clean architecture.

I love reviewing PRs! I love the opportunity to read other people's code and collaborate on improving the proposed solution.

## Personal projects

This is a list of my ongoing projects, which are at various stages of completion.

I love to tinker and build and would love to complete a simple electronics project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [boucherie-tools](https://github.com/anaiel/boucherie-tools)                     | SvelteKit, Tailwind, DaisyUI     | A suite of tools in an Astro powered app for my roller derby league, including converting items in a Notion database to text suitable for Discord, and an interactive heatmap to visualize where skaters pass their opponents on the track. I aim to serve my teammates and building niche tools is a lot of fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [personal-website](https://github.com/anaiel/personal-website)                   | Astro, Penpot                    | This is intended to be an ever-evolving, ever-growing site depending on what strikes my fancy at the time. I'm currently looking for a job, and I find a resume to be a pretty restrictive way to display my skills, especially as someone who has held different types of job. I want to highlight the continuity between being a teacher and a developer, and highlight some of the topics that I am particularly interested in (UX, code readability, accessibility, etc.). The goal at the moment is to build an interactive resume, while also learning more about design tools in the process. |
| [Data Journalism with Free Tools](https://journalismcourses.org/course/dataviz/) | dataviz                          | I'm also currently enrolled in the Data Journalism with Free Tools course. I'm interested in how code and data empowers storytelling: I'm a fan of [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/), data visualization, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
